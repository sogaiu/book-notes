# Chapter 2. Getting Started

A description of the chapter content is given.  The target audience is
specified.

The author claims that there is an activity that the reader can engage
in while reading the chapter that will lead to "getting more" from the
chapter.

Some idea of what one might learn from following the course of action
is explained.

## Section 2.1. Interacting with Scheme

## Section 2.2. Simple Expressions

## Section 2.3. Evaluating Scheme Expressions

## Section 2.4. Variables and Let Expressions

## Section 2.5. Lambda Expressions

## Section 2.6. Top-Level Definitions

## Section 2.7. Conditional Expressions

## Section 2.8. Simple Recursion

## Section 2.9. Assignment

The author claims that certain kinds of variable assignments can be
useful.

Assignments are contrasted with the new binding creation of let and
lambda.

The name of the primitive used for assignment is stated.

Use of assignment is demonstrated for some cases via some examples.

Scheme's local variables and their binding process are contrasted with
that of "many" other programming languages.  A couple of consequences
are stated.

Two definitions of the quadratic formula are compared.  One that
mimicks an arrangement meant to mirror a style of expression from some
languages is contrasted with another, presented in a more idiomatic
Scheme style.
